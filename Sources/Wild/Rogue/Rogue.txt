Rogue remains rather oppressed on ladder at the moment. It is the least represented class across most ranks, while being marginally ahead of Hunter and Warlock at higher levels of play. Being marginally ahead of two classes that are almost dead on ladder, is not a good sign.

But even at its darkest times, Rogue was often a popular tournament choice in previous metagames. In KFT, things look even worse for Rogue. It’s difficult to find a good reason to include Rogue in a tournament lineup, as it doesn’t seem to reliably beat any of the popular meta decks. It was the second least represented class with only five players bringing it to the EU playoffs, barely edging out Hunter at the bottom of the pile. Currently, Warlock is a stronger tournament class than Rogue.

Things look so bleak that Rogue is reverting to memes. Dog played some of Nicholas Lord’s Combo Mill Rogue on stream, putting together an impressive run. Whether the deck will really stand up to a larger sample size remains to be seen.
