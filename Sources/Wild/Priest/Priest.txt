Priest has been one of the most prominent classes in Hearthstone since the release of Knights of the Frozen Throne, and for weeks now we’ve been alluding that it might only get better if the Druid class was weakened. Now that the balance changes have been announced, and not a single Priest card was touched, while every top tier deck was nerfed, many competitive players are already welcoming the future as Prieststone.

There are two Razakus Priest builds currently populating higher levels of play with ample success behind them. The first is Findan’s #1 legend finish build, built around the concept of heavy cycle originally popularized by RDU. The second is StrifeCro’s build, with which he has been on a tear on ladder early this month. It cuts the Potion/Horror combo for Auchenai/Circle, and drops Velen for Skulking Geist, changing its approach towards the Jade Druid matchup. Normally, beating Jade Druid requires you to cycle as quickly as possible in order to burn down the Druid before his Jades get out of hand. With this build, cycling into Geist is an alternative line that can enable you to use your hero power to run the Druid out of resources instead of targeting its life total.

Big Priest could be just as scary Razakus after the balance changes, since it suffers much more at the hand of Pirate Warrior than its highlander counterpart. Even now, the archetype continues to see success at the top end of ladder, with multiple players placing well with it.

In some wacky deck news, Emem took an aggro combo variant to a #18 legend peak last month. This build, which runs Lightwarden, Bittertide Hydra as well as the Divine Spirit/Inner Fire combo, will catch a lot of players offguard, as it is so different from anything Priest has ever run before. Perhaps, it’s a bit similar to Silence Priest in its beatdown playstyle.
