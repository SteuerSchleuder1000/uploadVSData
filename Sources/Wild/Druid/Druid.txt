It’s probably no surprise to you that Druid’s dominance in Standard has come to call at Wild’s door, too. Much like in Standard, Jade and Aggro Druid make up a respectable half of the tier 1 decks in Wild. With nerfs locked onto Spreading Plague and Innervate, how well existing Wild decks will weather the nerfs is still a mystery.

Knights of the Frozen Throne has seriously challenged our existing ideas of what Druid decks look like, with Ultimate Infestation rewarding hard-ramp strategies (and replacing Auctioneer as a draw package in Jade), Aggro Druid with Innervates conclusively edging out Egg Druid (just before Innervate’s incipient nerfing), and Giants Druid rising from the tumult of the Naga/Giants change as an early favorite shell for the interaction.

Jade Druid continues to be the ultimate late-game deck, picking up Malfurious, The Lich King, and Ultimate Infestation to seriously up its late-game inevitability. Aggro Druid rebuilds itself around Crypt Lord, a seemingly invulnerable taunt that protects its wide boards before it buffs them into a win. Giants Druid has seen a little refinement since initial lists began popping up; going from 6 to 8 giants makes it more consistent at finding an early combo.
