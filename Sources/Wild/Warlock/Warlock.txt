Warlock is one of the least represented classes in the game, and is another victim of the Druid infestation. The only new interesting build we have to share is the unique Mill Control Warlock from Sjoesie, with which he managed to peak near the #100 legend rank at the end of last season, following that up with a good climb in September after slightly modifying it. We’re featuring his latest build. The modification is cutting Brewmaster and Shadow Bolts for Gluttonous Ooze and Stonehill Defenders.

Until the changes to Druid come through, it’s likely that Warlock will only be appropriate for specific tournament scenarios. Bring the class to ranked play at your own risk and understand that you are bringing a knife to a gun (or golem) fight.
