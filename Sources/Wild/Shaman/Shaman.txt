Shaman is a one deck class for another week. Boasting decent matchups against aggressive decks, Token Shaman is a moderately strong deck on ladder. However, it struggles to beat Jade Druid as well as Razakus Priest. The deckâ€™s flex spot is mostly confined to tinkering with the number of Devolves and Saronite Chain Gang. Two Devolves are important in aggressive matchups, while Saronite Chain Gang curving into Thrall, Deathseer can steal games in your more difficult matchups.

Until Jade Druid, the Meta Boogeyman, is nerfed, slower variants of Shaman will see no play. There is no incentive to play Control Jade Shaman for example, when Jade Druid does everything better and destroys it in the Jade race.
