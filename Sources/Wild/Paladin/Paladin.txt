Murloc Paladin continues to be one of the top 4 win rate archetypes in Hearthstone. 7ack peaked at #3 legend towards the end of the season with Mitsuhide’s Stormwatcher build, dropping Golakka Crawler for Grimscale Chum. There is a hot debate regarding the merit of Stormwatcher and whether its synergy with Corpsetaker is worth including. We’re also seeing non-Corpsetaker builds being played, but they haven’t gained as much traction recently. One interesting option is running Cobalt Scalebane along with The Curator, which provides you with more longevity and improves the matchup against Priest. Stonehill Defender is another option to give the deck a bit more late game value.

Control Paladin continues to flounder on ladder and is one of the primary victims of Jade Druid, but its miserable matchup against Razakus Priest and Murloc Paladin are nearly as crippling. The archetype is stuck between a rock and a hard place, as the ladder environment is extremely hostile towards it. Build it anti-aggro, and you get destroyed by Jade Druid and Priest. Try to fit in more late game value, and suddenly your matchups against aggressive decks turn dark red. In addition, the class lacks card draw that could push it in the direction of a consistent Beardo/Horsemen OTK. You may see this deck in tournament play, as the availability of a ban opens up some room for it to target specific matchups, but on ladder its success is a rarity. 

Handbuff Paladin is a viable ladder choice, but its power level is considerably lower than that of other options. It doesn’t actually seem to have any meaningful distinction in matchups from Murloc, which means it’s struggling to find a specific niche for ladder play that separates it in some way from the alternatives.
