The Pirate class is still going strong. Most of the builds remain the same as they’ve been since the beginning of the expansion, though double Spellbreakers is becoming standard over Phantom Freebooter. We’re seeing some players bringing back Leeroy Jenkins. The card was cut from most lists over the last couple of weeks, which means opponents are not playing around its reach, so it can catch people off guard. Leeroy’s weakness is that it’s a terrible card in your worst matchups, so consider including it over a Southsea Deckhand if you’re running into a lot of Priests and Jade Druids rather than token decks.

Other Warrior decks are not really able to hang in the current meta. Taunt Warrior was quite successful in the EU playoffs, but should not be played on ladder. Banning Jade Druid allows it to target aggressive strategies, but its matchup with the green men is so horrendous that it’s nearly unplayable in a ladder environment. If you’re feeling particularly brave, you could try taking Dog’s Fatigue Control list for a spin or alternatively, Casie’s modified N’Zoth Warrior list. Dog hit #2 legend with his latest build just recently, and it does not contain Fiery War Axe! Make sure to stay away from the green men, though.
