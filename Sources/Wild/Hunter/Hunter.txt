Only three players decided to bring Hunter to the EU Summer playoffs this weekend, and unsurprisingly, even in a Druid-free meta, the class underperformed. The balance changes could bring life to the class, as all of the top meta decks were nerfed to some degree. However, if Hunter doesnâ€™t rise from the ashes now, it will end up being a dead class for a full year, starting from Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, the time when Patches entered the scene and made it obsolete. This is make or break time.
