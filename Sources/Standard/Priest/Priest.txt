It was fun while it lasted. Priest is no longer the most popular class in Hearthstone. That being said, the number 2 spot isn’t too shabby. Priest was always going to hit the ground running once the balance changes went live considering it was the most prominent deck in the game that wasn’t hit by nerfs.  The rise of Tempo Rogue was unexpected, but Priest is certainly in a great spot considering this matchup is quite manageable. This is likely the strongest the Priest class has ever been in the history of the game.

Razakus Priest is one of the strongest decks in the game, though as we’ve said before, its success is reliant on a proper meta read and it does have a learning curve. Hunterace won the Rat Race to legend with the archetype. Most frontrunners of the race to legend competition opted for Tempo Rogue, and Hunterace outplayed the competition with a build teched to beat Rogues. With so many powerful battlecry minions available for Rogue, Dirty Rat becomes enticing (albeit, still dangerous to play early), and it is also quite strong in the mirror. Another interesting card is Holy Fire, which offers a way to remove a Cobalt Scalebane while also being a decent mirror card that can tilt the health race in your favor. Finally, Golakka Crawler is the most straight forward tech choice against Tempo Rogue. If you’re running into a more diverse meta, the standard list and the circle list, which are intentionally light on narrow tech, will serve you very well.
