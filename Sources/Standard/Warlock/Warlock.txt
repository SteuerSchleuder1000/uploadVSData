The return of Warlock was not exaggerated and the class is finally competitive once again after an extended period out of the spotlight. Zoo in particular continues to perform at a high level and its ability to control the board in the early to midgame is valuable in the current meta, especially after the hit to early board control powerhouses in Innervate and Fiery War Axe.

GingaNinja finished #22 legend with Noblord’s Zoo Warlock build, which has a lower curve than more standard lists. Glacial Shard is the most significant innovation, offering a very cheap tempo swing with its powerful ability, while both Vicious Fledgling and Darkshire Councilman are notable absences, with the deck being hyper focused on cheaply controlling the early game board state.

Control Warlock hasn’t demonstrated increased ladder success in the last week and is generally a weaker choice. Its biggest advantage is its arsenal of AOEs, which makes it very effective against Shaman, but Priests and Jade Druids usually steal its lunch money. With that being said, Dog managed to peak at #5 towards the end of last season with a mill-based control build including the Treachery/Howlfiend combo. This deck is still experimental and should only be played at your own risk, or for fun.
