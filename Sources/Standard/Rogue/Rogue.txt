Tempo Rogue has risen to the top of the meta. Many players turned to Tempo Rogue for their end-of-season climbs. This trend led the deck to be the highest represented at legend and across all ranks, as well as arguably being the most successful, with the archetype scoring seemingly endless top legend rank finishes for the month of September.

The archetype is currently extremely diverse in its builds. For clarity purposes regarding build direction, we can split most of its builds into three major categories: The Hydra builds, the Scalebane builds and the non-Keleseth builds.

The Hydra builds excel in the Jade Druid matchup. Bittertide Hydra is still a very strong card against Priest, but where it shines even more is against an opponent who has zero answers to it. Muzzy peaked at #2 legend as the month drew to a close with his Hydra list. Other than their usual and consistent utility, the two Tar Creepers can help protect the Hydra from opponent trades, while the Plague Scientist adds another removal tool for taunts, which helps the Hydra connect to the face more often.

The Scalebane builds are the most popular, and they perform relatively well in the Priest matchup while not being as all-in. Rookie hit #1 legend last month with a build that runs Barnes. Barnes works well with Scalebane as well as other targets such as Xaril, to shore up the deck’s often weak turn 4. Barnes also synergizes with Shadowstep in the late game to fish for a high impact card that wouldn’t have direct synergy with Barnes otherwise, such as Bonemare or Vilespine Slayer. We’ve also seen this build get greedier, running Cairne instead of the single Tar Creeper or a Cold Blood. Kranich hit #1 legend adding a Curator package of Vicious Fledgling and Coldlight Oracle to go along with the Scalebanes.

The non-Keleseth builds have emerged as a result of Tempo Rogue’s dominance and are aimed to target the mirror matchup (and are less recommended for a diverse meta). Eviscerate is a very efficient removal tool and provides reach in control matchups when necessary. Both Gyong and Kagome hit #1 legend with non-Keleseth builds, a testament to the current strength of the Tempo Rogue shell. We’re featuring Kagome’s build, which goes one step further at targeting the mirror by running a Golakka Crawler.

Miracle Rogue is still out there, though it is quite outnumbered and overshadowed. Ruby finished #21 legend with the archetype, piloting a Vanish build that runs Valanar at the 4 mana slot.
