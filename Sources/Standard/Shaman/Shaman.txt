Shaman continues to see a decent amount of usage on the back of the class’ most popular and only real archetype: Token Shaman. Diversity in the class though is sorely lacking. Not only is Shaman a one archetype class, Token Shaman is nearly a one build archetype. Two Devolves or two Saronite Chain Gangs is the biggest decision you’ll make with the deck, though some players add Golakka Crawler to further improve the matchup against Rogue.

While this archetype is more or less firm in its choice of cards, from time to time players explore taking Evolve in another direction. Thijs brewed up an Evolve Shaman list that’s closer to the control side of the spectrum, with more AOE spells as well as a bigger and slower Jade package. This route has been experimented with plenty of times, and falls short to Token Shaman in terms of power level, due to the lack of pressure.
