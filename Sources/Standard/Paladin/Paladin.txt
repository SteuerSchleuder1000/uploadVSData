Not much has changed for Paladin since last week. Murloc Paladin is leading the way for what feels like the eleventy-billionth week in a row and for good reason – it is a very strong deck still. It has a plethora of favored matchups in the current meta with the exception of Tempo Rogue and Token Shaman. Perhaps its poor matchup with Rogue is causing players to shy away from the deck, even though its standing against the rest of the meta is quite good.

Handbuff Paladin is still being played, but does get overrun by aggressive decks that get on the board faster. Aggro Paladin may have more potential, with builds such as Gcttirth’s Keleseth list taking advantage of Divine Favor’s inherent strength against slower decks.

It wouldn’t be a Paladin write-up without someone hitting a good legend rank with Control Paladin. This week it is Wabeka’s list which is so thirsty for targeted removal and draw that it is even running the Hammer of Wrath. Tempo Rogue does have a lot of 3 health minions so the tech choice makes sense. As usual, the disclaimer around running this archetype is that you are likely to play long games, and you are likely to lose them. Razakus Priest tends to destroy your soul.
