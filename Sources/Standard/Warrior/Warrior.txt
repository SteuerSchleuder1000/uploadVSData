Things still aren’t looking good for Warrior. Pirate Warrior is the only archetype that’s displaying a good performance level against the field, while the rest of the class has been reduced to ashes.

Things are so dire for the class that it is beginning to do what bad classes do: Resort to memes. Monsanto, one of the greatest memers in the competitive scene, hit top legend with an OTK Warrior deck, based on a combo of Don Han’Cho, Leeroy Jenkins, Sudden Genesis and Inner Rage. While Monsanto did manage to hit #9 with the deck, it remains to be seen if mere mortals or less successful combo deck players can replicate this success. At least it provides some new direction to a class recoiling from losing its best card. Worth trying out.
