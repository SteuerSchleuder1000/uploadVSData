The Mage class has settled into a mediocre spot in the meta. It retains three different archetypes that see some play and have been around for most of this meta, but none of them has made a significant impact on it, or are projected to do so.

Nevertheless, with a basis of some very strong cards such as Arcanologist and Primordial Glyph, it is hard to imagine the class completely disappearing as some classes have in past metas. Secret Mage has decent matchups with Jade Druid and Razakus Priest, which gives it some relevance. However, the new Tempo Rogue, Token Shaman and the rise of Zoo hurts the archetype’s chance of breaking through. Exodia Mage has, as ever, polarizing matchups. It feasts upon slower decks whilst capitulating to aggressive openings. The bottom line for it on ladder is not good enough. Control Mage does have some potential, but struggles to balance out its ability to fend off aggressive decks while not getting completely stomped by Jade Druid and Razakus Priest. Sjow’s build is the latest iteration to have had some success climbing early this month.

There has been little development or creation of new Mage decks recently. Overall, it feels like the class is crying out for some new ideas but whether that can and will occur until the next expansion remains to be seen.
