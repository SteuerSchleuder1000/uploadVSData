Druid is still a very powerful class in the post-patch meta, with both of its primary archetypes, Jade and Aggro-Token Druid, being able to overcome the hit on Innervate and maintain strong performances against the field.

Jade Druid’s standard build is settling down around running two Doomsayers in order to combat aggression consistently. Tar Creeper, Spellbreaker, Kun and the 2nd Mire Keeper are flex spots in the build that can be replaced based on the meta. While Doomsayer is a strong anti-aggro card in general, Golakka Crawler is an optional tech choice specifically aimed at Rogue. Primordial Drake is a stabilization late game tool that can improve your performance against board flooding decks such as Token Shaman.

Casie’s build maximizes pressure and value through Medivh as well as the board buff package, making it very effective against Priest. Medivh helps in mirrors, against Priest, and against decks running Skulking Geist.

JAB peaked at top 20 legend last month with a different, faster take on Jade Druid. The build runs the early game beast/buff package of Aggro Druid instead of ramp cards and reactive cards such as Spreading Plague. The deck aims to fight for board control from turn 1 and pressure control decks early, utilizing the Jade package for tempo rather than relying on a value plan.

Aggro-Token Druid has undergone much experimentation this week and remains very powerful despite the drop in its popularity since the balance changes. Dschmitt hit top 50 legend in September with a fairly standard build that cuts Bittertide Hydra. Genzo can be replaced with a second Southsea Captain, and it’s arguably an upgrade considering how powerful the Captain is on turn 3 with Patches, while Genzo is quite weak in aggressive mirrors. The most interesting development in the archetype is DerpyTroller’s top 30 legend peak with a variant that runs Pilfered Power and Ultimate Infestation. The goal of this deck is to flood the board, and then leverage its board presence to ramp through Pilfered Power and drop Ultimate Infestation. This build, unlike other iterations, has fantastic longevity. The cost, of course, is its early game consistency.
