Hunter’s play rate and win rate continued to fall this week as it’s been brought down by Tempo Rogue and Token Shaman. Hunter decks only have the crabs as a major early game swing in these matchups, so some have started to just include the crabs alongside their powerful late game to have a shot against the wide tempo decks of the meta while simultaneously targeting Priests.

Izzy peaked at top 50 legend with a Midrange Hunter build that showcases this. Fire Fly and the pirate package are omitted for the high-roll potential of Hungry Crab. Izzy’s build also includes Deathstalker Rexxar with two Hydra’s and two Highmanes. The mid-late game beefiness of the deck allows it to make up lost percentage in the Tempo Rogue matchup by doing better against Razakus Priests, who struggle to remove Bittertides and Highmanes, and are forced to race you if you start building Zombeasts.

Overall, the main difference in Hunter builds right now is the early game, with three different techs available of Pirates, Firefly, or Hungry Crab in the one drop slot. Each one has their benefits and downsides, with Firefly being well rounded, Patches being stronger against non- Golakka decks but targetable, and Hungry Crab being a heavy swing in the Paladin matchup as well as reasonable against Shaman.
